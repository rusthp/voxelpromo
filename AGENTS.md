## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Task Management Rules (HIGHEST PRECEDENCE)

**MANDATORY**: All task creation MUST follow Rulebook task management system.

**📋 ALWAYS reference `/rulebook/RULEBOOK.md` FIRST before creating any tasks or when "openspec" is mentioned.**

**Rules from RULEBOOK.md take precedence over all other rules in this file.**

**Key Requirements:**
- ✅ Context7 MCP is REQUIRED for task creation
- ✅ All tasks MUST follow OpenSpec-compatible format
- ✅ Use `rulebook task create` instead of OpenSpec commands
- ✅ Always validate task format before committing
- ❌ NEVER create tasks without checking RULEBOOK.md format requirements
- ❌ NEVER use OpenSpec commands - use Rulebook task system instead

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Task File Structure Rules

**MANDATORY**: When creating or updating tasks, you MUST follow the correct file structure:

**✅ CORRECT File Structure:**
- `proposal.md` - **Why** and **What Changes** (detailed explanations go here)
- `tasks.md` - **ONLY checklist items** (simple `- [ ]` or `- [x]` format)
- `specs/<module>/spec.md` - **Technical specifications** (SHALL/MUST requirements)
- `design.md` - **Technical design decisions** (optional, for complex features)

**❌ FORBIDDEN Practices:**
- ❌ **NEVER** add long explanations or specifications in `tasks.md`
- ❌ **NEVER** put technical details in `tasks.md` (use `specs/` instead)
- ❌ **NEVER** create `README.md` or `README` files in task directories
- ❌ **NEVER** create `PROCESS.md` or `PROCESS` files in task directories
- ❌ **NEVER** create any file not listed in the correct structure above

**What Goes Where:**

1. **`proposal.md`** - Use for:
   - Detailed "Why" explanations (minimum 20 characters)
   - "What Changes" descriptions
   - Impact analysis
   - Business/technical rationale

2. **`tasks.md`** - Use ONLY for:
   - Simple checklist items: `- [ ] Task description`
   - Status updates: `- [x] Completed task`
   - Brief comments: `<!-- tested, coverage: 95% -->`
   - **DO NOT** add long explanations, specifications, or technical details here

3. **`specs/<module>/spec.md`** - Use for:
   - Technical specifications with SHALL/MUST requirements
   - Scenario definitions (Given/When/Then)
   - Delta operations (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED)
   - All detailed technical requirements

4. **`design.md`** - Use for (optional):
   - Architecture decisions
   - Technical design rationale
   - Complex implementation details

**Example of WRONG usage:**
```markdown
# tasks.md (WRONG - too much detail)

## Implementation
- [ ] Create authentication system
  The system SHALL implement JWT-based authentication...
  Users MUST be able to login with email and password...
  The system MUST validate tokens...
```

**Example of CORRECT usage:**
```markdown
# tasks.md (CORRECT - simple checklist)

## 1. Implementation Phase
- [ ] 1.1 Create authentication module
- [ ] 1.2 Add JWT token generation
- [ ] 1.3 Implement password validation

# specs/auth/spec.md (CORRECT - specifications here)

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Authentication System
The system SHALL implement JWT-based authentication.

#### Scenario: User Login
Given a user with valid credentials
When the user submits login form
Then the system MUST return a JWT token
```

**Remember:**
- ✅ `tasks.md` = Simple checklist only
- ✅ `proposal.md` = Why and what changes
- ✅ `specs/` = Technical specifications
- ❌ No README, PROCESS, or other files

**For complete task management guidelines, see: `/rulebook/RULEBOOK.md`**

## Core Rules

This project uses @hivellm/rulebook standards.

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. **ALWAYS check `RULEBOOK.md` first** when creating tasks or if "openspec" is mentioned
2. Write tests first (95%+ coverage required)
3. Run quality checks before committing:
   - Type check / Compiler check
   - Linter (no warnings allowed)
   - All tests (100% pass rate)
   - Coverage check
4. Update docs/ when implementing features
5. Follow strict documentation structure
6. **NEVER run destructive deletions (`rm -rf`) in this repository; when adding submodules always use `git submodule add`.**
7. **Temporary files and scripts**:
   - ✅ ALL scripts MUST be created in `/scripts` directory
   - ✅ ALL temporary files (test, log, debug) MUST be in `/scripts`
   - ✅ ALL temporary files MUST be removed immediately after use (MANDATORY)
   - ❌ NEVER create temporary files in project root or outside `/scripts`
   - ❌ NEVER leave temporary files after use - clean up before committing

## Detailed Rules

For comprehensive rules, see the corresponding files in `/rulebook/`:

- `/rulebook/RULEBOOK.md` - **Task management rules (HIGHEST PRECEDENCE)**
- `/rulebook/QUALITY_ENFORCEMENT.md` - Quality enforcement rules
- `/rulebook/GIT.md` - Git workflow rules

Language-specific rules are in `/rulebook/`.
Module-specific patterns are in `/rulebook/`.

When in doubt, ask to review @AGENTS.md first.
