## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Task Management Rules (HIGHEST PRECEDENCE)

**MANDATORY**: All task creation MUST follow Rulebook task management system.

**📋 ALWAYS reference `/rulebook/RULEBOOK.md` FIRST before creating any tasks or when "openspec" is mentioned.**

**Rules from RULEBOOK.md take precedence over all other rules in this file.**

**Key Requirements:**
- ✅ Context7 MCP is REQUIRED for task creation
- ✅ All tasks MUST follow OpenSpec-compatible format
- ✅ Use `rulebook task create` instead of OpenSpec commands
- ✅ Always validate task format before committing
- ❌ NEVER create tasks without checking RULEBOOK.md format requirements
- ❌ NEVER use OpenSpec commands - use Rulebook task system instead

**For complete task management guidelines, see: `/rulebook/RULEBOOK.md`**

## Core Rules

This project uses @hivellm/rulebook standards.

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. **ALWAYS check `RULEBOOK.md` first** when creating tasks or if "openspec" is mentioned
2. Write tests first (95%+ coverage required)
3. Run quality checks before committing:
   - Type check / Compiler check
   - Linter (no warnings allowed)
   - All tests (100% pass rate)
   - Coverage check
4. Update docs/ when implementing features
5. Follow strict documentation structure
6. **NEVER run destructive deletions (`rm -rf`) in this repository; when adding submodules always use `git submodule add`.**
7. **Temporary files and scripts**:
   - ✅ ALL scripts MUST be created in `/scripts` directory
   - ✅ ALL temporary files (test, log, debug) MUST be in `/scripts`
   - ✅ ALL temporary files MUST be removed immediately after use (MANDATORY)
   - ❌ NEVER create temporary files in project root or outside `/scripts`
   - ❌ NEVER leave temporary files after use - clean up before committing
